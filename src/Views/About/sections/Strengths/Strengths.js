          <li><strong>Pattern Mapping</strong>: I'm often in a mode of inquiry and retrospection. Optimization is often in the forefront of my mind when working through a task. This is great for maintaining a strong and consistent software architecture.</li>
          <li><strong>Gap Detection</strong>: Finding logical disconnects can be useful. I can help to find holes before the team falls into them.</li>
          <li><strong>Experimentation</strong>: When it's time to hammer out a truly difficult problem, my enthusiasm for exploration will come in handy. I like to discover what can be done with what we have.</li>
