        I have five years of experience building and wiring custom control panels for automated industrial machines. I would be given a set of wiring prints and I would decipher the layout of the control panel. I would then build it and wire it in accordance with UL 508-A standards. I also fabricated the enclosures for the panels and performed off-site technician work for our customers in the field.

        I took on many other responsibilities as well. I was nominated several times to serve on a council that represented the technicians of our shop. I would collaborate with the company owners to come up with ideas for higher productivity and to relay the concerns of shop technicians directly to the owners. This was a new role at our company, and I enjoyed it.

        I was also a trainer for new-hire wire technicians. Rarely we would onboard an experienced technician, so we needed someone to teach new-hires the basics of constructing and wiring with quality and care. While in this role, I wrote up a step-by-step document that describes the process on how to build control panels and troubleshooting for certain problems during contstruction.
