        I had a software engineering internship creating touch screens for human-machine interface controllers. I enjoyed learning new things every day. I built programmable touch screens for a 300ft long automated machine that that creates 3M velcro hook and loop. The complicated machine was split into different sections and each section had many tasks that an operator would need to perform by using the touch screens that I created.
