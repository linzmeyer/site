          The Oakdale Discovery Center is a large nature preserve in Washington County, MN. They are always looking for ways to attract more people to appreciate the natural world they have preserved by hosting different events and activities. I built a game for people to play as they explore the park. The purpose of the game is for people to learn trivial facts about our local natural world.

          The admin has the ability to customize the game with clues and answers about the flora and fauna that one can discover in the park as well as a reward for winning the game. The game tracks the player's progress and exposes letters to the final answer with every clue answered.

          I completed this project on my own, but I learned to ask for help when I needed it and to help others with their projects when they needed me regardless of our time contraints. I was given 3 weeks to complete this application from scoping to preparing a presentation.
