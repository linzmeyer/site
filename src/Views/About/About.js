                I have spent a lot of time understanding myself. I felt that <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >this personality test</a> did a great job at helping me understand some things about myself. It describes me as an advocate who loves helping others discover their true potential. Helping others to help themselves is a true joy of mine.
